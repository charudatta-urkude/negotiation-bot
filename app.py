    # NEW MODIFICATION: Updated prompt with examples for each intent and additional factors.
    extraction_prompt = f"""
Extract detailed negotiation parameters from the following customer message:
- Customer message: "{customer_message}"

Your task is to extract the following fields:

1. extracted_offer: The absolute numerical offer mentioned in the message (if any).  
   - Example: "My final offer is 850" should yield extracted_offer = 850.
   - Example: "I can get it for 750" should yield extracted_offer = 750.
   
2. increment: If the customer indicates a relative increase, extract that numerical value as a positive number.
   - Example: "I can give 10 more" or "I can add 10" should yield increment = 10 (and effective_offer = last_offer + 10).
   - Example: "Add 5 more" should yield increment = 5.

3. decrement: If the customer indicates a relative decrease, extract that numerical value as a positive number.
   - Example: "I can only reduce it by 20" should yield decrement = 20.

4. quantity: If a bulk order is mentioned, extract the number of units.
   - Example: "2 for 1600" should yield quantity = 2.
   - If no quantity is mentioned, default to 1.

5. intent: Determine the negotiation intent using these categories:
***"affirmative": if the customer agrees to the last counter-offer without specifying a new number.****
         * Example: "Okay", "Sure", "Yes", "Works for me", "I'll take it", "Let's go with this."
   - "final_offer": if the customer states a definitive final price.
         * Example: "My final offer is 850."
   - "discount_request": if the customer explicitly asks for a discount.
         * Example: "Can you give me a discount? I can pay 800."
   - "hesitation": if the customer shows uncertainty or hesitation.
         * Example: "I'm not sure, maybe around 810?" or "I need to think about this."
   - "negotiate": if the customer is open to further discussion.
         * Example: "Can I get it at 800?" or "How about 820?" 
   - "other": if none of the above apply.
         * Example: "I'm interested, but not sure about the price."
   - Also include any cases not covered by these examples if needed.

6. tone: Identify the emotional tone of the message.
   - Examples: "aggressive" (e.g., "Your price is ridiculous!"), "emotional" (e.g., "I'm really desperate."), "neutral", or "friendly".

7. ambiguity: If the message is ambiguous, include a note explaining the ambiguity.
   - Example: "No clear number provided" if the message is vague.

8. competitor_offer: If the customer references a competitorâ€™s price, extract that value.
   - Example: "Competitor X is offering 750" should yield competitor_offer = 750.

9. shipping_needed: If the message mentions shipping terms, extract that information.
   - Example: "If you include free shipping" should yield shipping_needed = true.
   - Example: "rush shipping" should capture that information (can be a boolean or descriptive string).

10. payment_terms: If the message includes conditions like installment or partial payment, extract that as a string.
    - Example: "I need to pay in installments" should yield payment_terms = "installments".

11. trade_in: If the customer mentions trading in an old item, return true.
    - Example: "I'll trade in my old phone" should yield trade_in = true.


12. effective_offer: Compute the effective offer as follows:
    - If an "increment" is provided, effective_offer = last_offer + increment.
         * Example: last_offer=800 and "I can give 10 more" results in effective_offer = 810.
    - Else if a "decrement" is provided, effective_offer = last_offer - decrement.
         * Example: last_offer=800 and "I can reduce my offer by 20" yields effective_offer = 780.
    - Else if "extracted_offer" is provided and quantity > 1, effective_offer = extracted_offer divided by quantity.
         * Example: "2 for 1600" yields effective_offer = 800.
    - Otherwise, effective_offer = last_offer.

Return a valid JSON object exactly in the following format:
{{
    "extracted_offer": null,
    "increment": 0.0,
    "decrement": 0.0,
    "quantity": 1,
